# A Bento Layout with CSS Grid

A simple, visual demonstration of a CSS grid-based bento layout, using differing techniques: one demonstrating auto-placement with `grid-auto-flow` and utility classes, and another demonstrating explicit placement with `grid-column` and `grid-row` along with `:nth-child`.

This demo showcases how to create flexible, responsive grid layouts with tiles of varying sizes using CSS Grid.

## Purpose

This demo was created to accompany an article that explains how to build bento-style layouts using CSS Grid. Each tile in the demo is clearly labeled with its dimensions (columns × rows) and corresponding CSS class, making it easy to understand how the grid system works.

## Features

- **12-column grid system** for flexible tile sizing
- **Multiple tile sizes**: Tiles of differing sizes and colors
- **Responsive design** with breakpoints for tablet and mobile devices
- **Color-coded tiles** for easy visual distinction between tile types
- **Dense grid packing** for optimal space utilisation
